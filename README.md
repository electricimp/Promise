# Promise Class 1.0.0

This Promise class is based on the PromiseJS definition at:
https://www.promisejs.org/implementing/

According to Wikipedia, "Futures and promises originated in functional programming and 
related paradigms (such as logic programming) to decouple a value (a future) from how 
it was computed (a promise), allowing the computation to be done more flexibly, notably 
by parallelizing it."

This Promise class implements a subset of the generic Promise concept by
providing two callback functions, then() and fail(). then() is executed when the 
promise is successfully completed, fail() is executed when the promise is completed
with any sort of detectible failure. Usually, an instantiated Promise object is 
returned from a class instead of offering direct callback functions. This uniform
implementation makes the code clearer and easier to read.

**To add this library to your project, add `#require "promise.class.nut:1.0.0"` to the top of your device code.**

You can view the library's source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/electricimp/Promise/tree/v1.0.0).

## Class Usage

### Constructor: Promise( *actionFunction(fulfill, reject)* )

The constructor should receive a single function, which will be executed to determine the final value and result. The actionFunction should receive two function parameters. Exactly one of these functions (`fulfill` or `reject`) should be executed at the completing of the actionFunction. If `fulfill` is executed then the success function will be called asynchronously; if `reject` is executed then the fail function will be called asynchronously.

### then( *successFunction* [, *failFunction* ] )

This function allows the developer to provide a success function and optionally a fail function. The success function should accept a single parameter, the result; the fail function should accept a single parameter, the error.

### fail( *failFunction* )

This function allows the developer to provide a failure function. The failure function should accept a single parameter, the error.

### finally( *alwaysFunction* )

This function allows the developer to provide a function that is executed once the promise is resolved or rejected, regardless of the success/failure. Accepts a single parameter â€“ result or error.

## Example

An example implementation of a promise is:

```squirrel
class Widget {
    
    function _longTask(data, callback) {
        // Some long asynchronous task which calls callback at the end
    }
    
    function calculate(input) {
        return Promise(function (fulfill, reject) {
            _longTask(input, function (err, res) {
                if (err) {
                    reject(err);
                } else {
                    fulfill(res);
                }
            }.bindenv(this));
        }.bindenv(this));
    }
}
```

An example execute of this class and promise is:

```squirrel
Widget().calculate(123)
        .then(
            function(res) {
                server.log("Success: " + res)
            }.bindenv(this)
        )
        .fail(
            function(err) {
                server.error("Failed: " + err)
            }.bindenv(this)
        )
        .finally(
            function(r) {
                server.log("I'm called always")
            }.bindenv(this)
        )
```
